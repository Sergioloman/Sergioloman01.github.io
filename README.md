# Code Refactor Starter Code
Welcome to the Horiseon site, our focus when designinig this site is accesibility for all ( and that includes web devs as well )

**HTML Semantincs**
we have the following elements
*<header>
    here we have our *<nav>* element with each item in the menu linked to their correspondent content in the middle of the page
*<sections>
        You will find 3 main sections in the document:

    *<article>
        Here we describe the contents of the program. each article has been named "explanation"

    *<aside>

    *<footer>
        Footers must match the headers in some way so we gave it the exact same styling as the one you can see in the <nav> element.
