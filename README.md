# Code Refactor Starter Code
Welcome to the Horiseon site, our focus when designinig this site is accesibility for all ( and that includes web devs as well )

**HTML Semantincs**
we have the following elements
*<header>
    here we have our *<nav>* element with each item in the menu linked to their correspondent content in the middle of the page
*<sections>
    this is the bulk of our 
*<article>
*<aside>
*<footer>
